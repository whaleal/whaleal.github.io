# Cluster Health

**Quick diagnosis**

Quick diagnosis includes the latency of both the WAP platform and agent hosts (WhalealLag), basic information of the hosts (HostInfo), more detailed real-time host resource utilization (RealHostInfo), basic information of MongoDB instances (MongoInfo), and more detailed real-time MongoDB instance information (RealMongoInfo). These pieces of information can assist in evaluating the performance, availability, and health status of MongoDB, thereby enabling appropriate optimization and adjustment measures.
