# OnPremise Install Whaleal 

## Prerequisites

You must have administrative access on the hosts to which you install.

Before you install Whaleal, you must:

1. Plan your configuration. See [Installation Checklist.](../01-InstallationChecklist.md)

2. Deploy hosts that meet the [Whaleal System Requirements.](../02-HardwareAndSoftwareRequirements.md)

   > **IMPORTANT**
   >
   > Your Whaleal instance can fail in production if you fail to configure the following:
   >
   > - Whaleal hosts per the [Whaleal System Requirements.](../02-HardwareAndSoftwareRequirements.md)
   > - MongoDB hosts per the Production Notes in the MongoDB manual. MongoDB instances in Whaleal include:
   >   - The Whaleal Application Database,
   >   - Each blockstore.

3. Install the Whaleal Application Database and optional Backup Database. The databases require *dedicated* MongoDB instances. *Don't* use MongoDB installations that store other data. Whaleal requires the Backup Database if you use the Backup feature.

The Whaleal Application must authenticate to the backing databases as a MongoDB user with appropriate access.
