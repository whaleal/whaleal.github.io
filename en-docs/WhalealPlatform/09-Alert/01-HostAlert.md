# Host Alert

When Whaleal is used to manage a host for the first time, Whaleal detects that the host is a new host and initializes it. The alart mode directly inherits the alart indicators in the current Project. If you want to configure different alart indicators in the project, you can select the host of the server in the Host drop-down box in Host Alert and configure it separately.

## Select Project

1. Click Alert in the navigation bar.
2. Click Host Alert on the Alert Message page.
3. In the host drop-down box, select the server for which you want to configure an alart.

## Send alerts

When the alart value is triggered, we can see the current alart in open Alert, and we can search in MSG or configure the time interval to view the alart within a period of time.

Alert will also send the alert to a specific platform through the information configured in the alert platform configured in Groups in the Project. For the configuration process, refer to [Project Alert](./03-ProjectAlert.md).
